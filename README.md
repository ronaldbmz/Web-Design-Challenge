# Web-Design-Challenge

### Completed Web Design Challenge with the following designed web pages:
- A landing page containing:
  1. An explanation of the project.
  2. Links to each visualizations page such that clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

- Four visualization pages, each with:
  1. A descriptive title and heading tag.
  2. The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  3. A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

- A "Comparisons" page that:
  1. Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  2. Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

- A "Data" page that:
  1. Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  2. The table is a bootstrap component

### The website has, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
- Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
- Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
- Provides "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.

### The web pages have been deployed to github pages and can be viewed at: https://ronaldbmz.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html
